# üöÄ Build & Upload to Google Play Store - Complete Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Complete This On Your Local Computer

Google Play Store submission requires building the app on a machine with:
- Android SDK
- Java JDK
- Android Studio (recommended)

## üìã Prerequisites Checklist

- [ ] Google Play Developer Account ($25 one-time fee)
- [ ] Android Studio installed
- [ ] Java JDK 17 installed
- [ ] Android SDK installed
- [ ] Node.js and Yarn installed

## üîß Step 1: Setup Development Environment

### Install Android Studio
1. Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
2. Install and open Android Studio
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Appearance & Behavior ‚Üí System Settings ‚Üí Android SDK
4. Install:
   - Android SDK Platform 34
   - Android SDK Build-Tools 34.0.0
   - Android SDK Command-line Tools

### Set Environment Variables

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin

# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc to make permanent
```

**On Windows:**
```
ANDROID_HOME = C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
Path += %ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools
Path += %ANDROID_HOME%\tools
```

## üì¶ Step 2: Download and Setup Project

1. **Download the mobile folder from this workspace**
2. **Navigate to project:**
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Test the app works:**
   ```bash
   # Start an Android emulator first, then:
   yarn android
   ```

## üîê Step 3: Generate Release Keystore

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** Keep this keystore safe! You'll need it for ALL future updates.

```bash
cd android/app

keytool -genkeypair -v -storetype PKCS12 \
  -keystore evoxbiolabs-release-key.keystore \
  -alias evoxbiolabs-key-alias \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000 \
  -storepass Evox2024SecureKey \
  -keypass Evox2024SecureKey \
  -dname "CN=EvoX Biolabs, OU=Development, O=EvoX Biolabs, L=San Francisco, ST=California, C=US"
```

**Store these securely:**
- **Keystore file:** `evoxbiolabs-release-key.keystore`
- **Keystore password:** `Evox2024SecureKey`
- **Key alias:** `evoxbiolabs-key-alias`
- **Key password:** `Evox2024SecureKey`

üíæ **BACKUP:** Copy keystore to a safe location (cloud storage, password manager, etc.)

## üèóÔ∏è Step 4: Build Release AAB

### Clean Build (Recommended)
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
```

### Build AAB for Play Store
```bash

./gradlew assembleRelease
```

‚úÖ **Output Location:**
```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

## üìä Step 5: Verify Build

```bash
# Check AAB size (should be 15-30 MB)
ls -lh android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab

# Verify signing
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
